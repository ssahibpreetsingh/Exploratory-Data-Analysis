Air pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. WHO data show that almost all of the global population (99%) breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline limits and contains high levels of pollutants, with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures.
Air quality is closely linked to the earthâ€™s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the drivers of air pollution (i.e. combustion of fossil fuels) are also sources of greenhouse gas emissions. **Policies to reduce air pollution,therefore, offer a win-win strategy for both climate and health, lowering the burden of disease attributable to air pollution, as well as contributing to the near- and long-term mitigation of climate change.**


Objective of this Analysis is to find Air Pollution insights and build up fuctions so that deep research can be done with a single code. Majorly analysis is done for the following:

- Analysing Air Pollution Data
- Analysing Relation : Air Pollution with Weather Data
- Analysing Relation : Air Pollution with Demography
